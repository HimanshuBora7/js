const name = "bochie"
const repoCount = 50

//console.log(name + repoCount) // this syntax is an outdated way for concatination of strings 

//instead now we use backticks
//string interpolation (or variable interpolation, variable substitution, or variable expansion) is the process of evaluating a string literal containing one or more placeholders, yielding a result in which the placeholders are replaced with their corresponding values. It is a form of simple template processing[1] or, in formal terms, a form of quasi-quotation (or logic substitution interpretation). The placeholder may be a variable name, or in some languages an arbitrary expression, in either case evaluated in the current context.


console.log(`hello my name is ${name} and my repo count is ${repoCount}`)
